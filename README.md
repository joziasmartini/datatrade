## Project
In such a data-driven world, where the economy dominates and connects with everything, it's strange that accessing financial data is still complicated.

Imagine you, wanting to connect to some application to extract data from the financial market, but you are faced with exorbitant payment plans to gain access to data that should be public.

Thinking about solving this problem, Datatrade emerged, a robust and cloud-based application that provides financial data in milliseconds, without charging anything for it.

## Structure
This is how the API is structured in AWS and exposed to final users.
